'Unlike traditional VB 2010 properties, however, it is not possible to build read-only or write-only
'automatic properties. While you might think you can just omit the Get or Set within your property
'declaration as follows:
''Read-only property? Error!
'Public ReadOnly Property MyReadOnlyProp() As Integer
''Write only property? Error!
'Public WriteOnly Property MyWriteOnlyProp() As Integer
