//The IsCompleted property on the task allows you to determine if the asynchronous operation has completed.//While it is still completing, the task keeps the user happy by displaying dots; once it completes, you request the result
//of the task.Since you know the task has now completed, the result will immediately be displayed to the user.//This all looks good until you start to analyze the cost of achieving this asynchronous operation. In effect you now
//have two threads running for the duration of the download: the one running inside Main and the one attempting to get//the response from the web site.The thread responsible for getting the content is spending most of its time blocked on
//the line reader.ReadToEnd(); you have taken a thread from the thread pool, denying others the chance to use it, only//for it to spend most of the time idle.
//A far more efficient approach would be to create a thread to request the data from the web server, give the thread//back to the thread pool, and when the data arrives, obtain a thread from the pool to process the results.To achieve this
//prior to.NET 4.5, the I / O methods in the library use the APM idiom seen in Chapter 2://public virtual IAsyncResult BeginGetResponse(AsyncCallback callback, object state);
//public virtual WebResponse EndGetResponse(IAsyncResult asyncResult);//You could write your download code using this API, but you would actually like to continue to keep the
//DownloadAsync method returning a Task<string>â€”remember, the general goal of TPL is to represent every//asynchronous operation as a task. To enable this, there is yet another way to create a task called Task.Factory.
//FromAsync.This method takes an IAsyncResult to represent the lifetime of the task and a callback methd to call//when the asynchronous operation has completed. In the case where the task being created is a Task<T>, this method
//has the role of producing the result for the task, so it will return a value of type T.The code in Listing 3-16 is making//more efficient use of the thread pool by only consuming a thread when data arrives back from the web site.No threads
//are consumed from the pool while you are waiting for a response.
